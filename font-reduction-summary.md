## Implementation Details

### Approach
- Maintained existing responsive design structure
- Added font size reductions to existing media queries
- Applied consistent 10% reduction across all text elements
- Preserved visual hierarchy by reducing all elements proportionally

### Calculation Method
All font sizes were calculated as: `original_size * 0.9`

Examples:
- `1rem` → `0.9rem`
- `1.5rem` → `1.35rem`  
- `2rem` → `1.8rem`
- `clamp()` values were also reduced proportionally

### Breakpoints Affected
- **768px and below**: Tablet and mobile devices
- **480px and below**: Mobile-only devices

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test on actual mobile devices or browser developer tools
2. Verify readability is maintained across all pages
3. Check that text hierarchy remains clear
4. Ensure buttons and interactive elements are still easily tappable
5. Test across different screen sizes within the mobile range

## Browser Compatibility

These changes use standard CSS properties and should work across all modern browsers that support CSS media queries and rem units.

## Rollback Instructions

If font sizes need to be reverted, search for the comment `/* 10% smaller fonts */` or `* 0.9` in the CSS files to identify all modified font-size declarations and restore original values.
